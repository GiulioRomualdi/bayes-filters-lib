## Version 0.7.1.0
##### `Bugfix`
 - Fixed WhiteNoiseAcceleration implementation.


## Version 0.7.0.0
##### `Filtering classes`
 - Removed PFVisualCorrection::getVisualObservationModel() and PFVisualCorrection::setVisualObservationModel().

##### `Bugfix`
 - Fixed PF prediction and correction move constructor (minor fix).

##### `CMake`
 - Threads is now a dependency of the exported library. This will solve a CMake error during configuration in CMake projects linking BayesFilters.
 - BayesFilters is now fully relocatable.


## Version 0.6.2.0
### Updates
##### `Filtering classes`
 - Added ResamplingWithPrior class.
